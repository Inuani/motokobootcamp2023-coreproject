# Embryo Dao - experimental project

The project is deployed on the mainnet
at this address :

https://6mor4-vyaaa-aaaan-qc2wa-cai.ic0.app/

The frontend is not displaying the proposals
on the home page
but it is working on my local replica.

Also I did not find a way to make the image of
the logo appear.

Here is the backend canister with all the functions :

Next thing to work on :
create a button to create a proposal
when someone is connected.
